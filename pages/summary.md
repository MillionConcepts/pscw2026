#### Summary Overview

This conference is targeted at professionals working in and around the field of planetary science, including scientists, engineers, students, policy-makers, and industry partners. All topics of specific interest to planetary scientists are responsive. With science at its core, this workshop will focus on community building, networking, and consensus-building about the state of the planetary science field overall and our goals and desires in a rapidly changing environment.

[Abstracts are solicited](abstracts.md) on any and all topics of relevance and importance to the planetary science community, including, but not limited to, the following broad themes: planetary formation, atmospheres, surfaces, interiors; space environment and weather; habitability and astrobiology; software, data, tools, and methods; physical materials; field work and analog studies; missions, instruments, and technology; support for crewed missions and human exploration, including Artemis; funding and policy (esp. at NASA); community advocacy and professional development; diversity, equity, and inclusion; commercial space; and so on.

With science at its core, this workshop will also focus on community building, networking, and consensus building about the state of the planetary science field overall and our goals and desires in a rapidly changing environment.

#### Format

The [format](agenda.md) will be a mixture of traditional research conference and unconference workshop. The mornings will be devoted to contributed presentations on scientific and other topics of emerging interesting. The afternoons will devoted to invited talks, panel discussions, small-group breakouts, and focused problem-solving and strategic planning around issues being faced by the field---whether those are scientific, technical, political, cultural, etc.

#### Proceedings

After the workshop, first authors of accepted abstracts will be invited to contribute longer documents to a ["proceedings" compendium](abstracts.md). The intention is that the proceedings contributions will be informed by interactions at the workshop, and that the proceedings compendium will form a snapshot, non-consensus record of topics, statuses, research, opinions, and recommendations related to the most pressing issues related to the field of planetary science.

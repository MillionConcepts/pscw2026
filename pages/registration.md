**Register for the Workshop through the Indico portal at [solarsystem.events](https://solarsystem.events/event/1/registrations/1/).**
:::

The registration fee is $300. The budget for this event is being entirely bootstrapped by registration fees. If we receive 50 paid registrations by January 31, then we will be able to cover [baseline costs](budget.md) for the event.
If we do not receive enough paid registrations by January 31, then we will cancel the event and all registration fees will be refunded. Therefore **please register early**. Total registration for the event is capped at 275 participants.

#### Scope

This conference is targeted at professionals working in and around the field of planetary science, including scientists, engineers, students, policy-makers, and industry partners. All topics of specific interest to planetary scientists are responsive.

With science at its core, this workshop will focus on community building, networking, and consensus-building about the state of the planetary science field overall and our goals and desires in a rapidly changing environment.

#### Format

The format will be a mixture of traditional research conference and unconference workshop. The mornings will be devoted to contributed presentations on scientific and other topics of emerging interesting. The afternoons will devoted to invited talks, panel discussions, small-group breakouts, and focused problem-solving and strategic planning around issues being faced by the field---whether those are scientific, technical, political, cultural, etc.

#### Proceedings

After the workshop, first authors of accepted abstracts will be invited to contribute longer documents to a "proceedings" compendium. The intention is that the proceedings contributions will be informed by interactions at the workshop, and that the proceedings compendium will form a snapshot, non-consensus record of topics, statuses, research, opinions, and recommendations related to the most pressing issues related to the field of planetary science.
